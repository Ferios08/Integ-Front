# Ionic-Demo APP
Here is a simple Ionic Demo that consumes a public Radios API.
You can: 
* search for Radios
* Save them as favorites.
* Set your favorite movies.
It consumes REST API and uses local storage for MySQL as a database.
the backend is a simple NodeJS server equiped with JWT for authentification.
Feel free to contribute and Add new features :)
